CHATGPT

1. Setup the Project: Start by setting up a Spring Boot project. You can use Spring Initializr to quickly set up the project with necessary dependencies.
2. Design the Database Schema: Identify the entities in your social media app. Some common entities could be User, Post, Comment, Like, and Follow. Design the relationships between these entities.
3. Create the Entities: Create the entity classes in your Spring Boot project corresponding to the database schema.
4. Create the Repositories: Use Spring Data JPA to create the repository interfaces for your entities.
5. Create the Services: Implement the business logic in service classes. These services will use the repositories to interact with the database.
6. Create the Controllers: Implement the controllers which handle HTTP requests. These controllers will use the services to perform operations.
7. Implement Security: Use Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization. You can implement features like signup, login, and secure access to certain endpoints.
8. Test Your Application: Write unit tests and integration tests to make sure your application works as expected.
